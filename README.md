# <prep>Image Classification Using L-Layer Neural Network<prep>

## Objective:
<p>In this project I will implement a L-Layer neural network for classifying an image as cat or not a cat. <p>
* I will build a complete neural network architecture from scratch using 4 modules and test the performance of this neural network.
* The 1st module is to initialize the parameters of the network
* The 2nd module implements forward propogation in the neural network
* The 3rd module implements backward propogation in the network
* The third module updates the parameters using gradient descent
